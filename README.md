# Bed_leveler_for_3d-ptinters

A very simple and easily modifiable and adaptable PCB for leveling the beds of 3d-printers and CNC machines. 
It does come with a hole and can be used as a keychain, for ease of carrying it arround in style.
A single layer PCB with no/low drills(Only 2 drills for the THT-led, Even those can be used as-is by placing an SMT-LED).
